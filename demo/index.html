                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    At FoodBridge, our mission is to connect local restaurants with people in need by redistributing surplus food. Every day, restaurants waste a significant amount of food that could be used to feed the hungry, and we're here to change that.
                </p>

            <div class="about-item box">
                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                    When restaurants donate their untouched, unused food to FoodBridge, they not only help feed the community but also unlock rewards through our Clean & Green Program. These rewards include essential services such as waste management and professional deep cleaning, ensuring your establishment stays spotless. Giving back has never been more rewarding!
                </p>

                <h2>Supporting Small Businesses</h2>
                <p>
                    FoodBridge creates a win-win by helping restaurants reduce food waste while feeding those in need. Every donation strengthens the community and supports sustainability, turning surplus into sustenance. Together, we build a cleaner environment and a stronger, more connected society!
