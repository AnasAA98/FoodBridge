          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At FoodBridge, our mission is to connect local restaurants with
            people in need by redistributing surplus food. Every day,
            restaurants waste a significant amount of food that could be used to
            feed the hungry, and we're here to change that.
          </p>

        <!-- Our Commitment to Charity -->
        <div class="about-item box">
          <h2>Our Commitment to Charity</h2>
          <p>
            We believe no food should go to waste while so many people struggle
            with hunger. Our commitment to charity drives us to ensure that
            excess food from restaurants is rerouted to those who need it most,
            creating a more sustainable and compassionate community.

          <h2>Supporting Small Businesses</h2>
          <p>
            FoodBridge also empowers small businesses to make a difference. By
            donating their unsold food, restaurants not only help reduce waste
            but also support those in their local communities who need it, all
            while enhancing their social impact.
